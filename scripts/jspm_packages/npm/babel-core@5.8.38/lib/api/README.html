<h2>API</h2><p>In this directory you&#39;ll find all the public interfaces to using Babel for both
node and the browser.</p>
<h3>Node</h3><p>There are two ways people use Babel within Node, they either are manipulating
strings of code with <code>babel.transform</code> or <code>babel.parse</code>, they also might be
running their code through Babel before execution via <code>register</code> or <code>polyfill</code>.</p>
<h3>Browser</h3><p>Usage of Babel in the browser is extremely uncommon and in most cases
considered A Bad Ideaâ„¢. However it works by loading <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>&#39;s with XHR,
transforming them and then executing them. These <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>&#39;s need to have a
<code>type</code> of &quot;text/ecmascript-6&quot;, &quot;text/babel&quot;, or &quot;module&quot; (&quot;text/6to5&quot; exists as
well for legacy reasons).</p>
